# WME URcomments CustomGSheets
This script is for Custom Comments, that are loaded from a Google Sheets backend, to be used with the script URComments.

## Prerequisites
This script must be used in conjuction with an associated Google Sheets spreadsheet with "publish to web" enabled for the "script output (do not edit)" tab.
### This Template
This template script uses the following Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnT1Pb9L6fwz-dGHQaiM__eBkHyfDqPI3lYbjemkvjc/edit?usp=sharing
The above google sheet includes all comments from standard "Custom URComments" template.

If you would like to use this and customize the responses for yourself, you will need to copy the above sheet, enable publsihing to web for the script output tab, and update the JSON_URL variable below.

If you would like to use a modified version of this for use in the list selection from within URComments for something other than "CustomGSheets", you will need to get with rickzabel to add a ListName for you. The name he gives you needs to be placed in the ListName variable below.

Thank you! - dBsooner
